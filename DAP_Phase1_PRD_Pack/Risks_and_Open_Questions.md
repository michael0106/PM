- Migration password resets may impact CPA experience; requires clear comms plan.
- Progressive tiers complexity (lifetime accumulation vs payout cycles) and edge-cases with plan changes and transfers.
- Agreement generation and confirmation timing vs plan effective timing may cause disputes.
- Allocation rule interactions with external lead routing; race conditions between auto-allocation and manual reassignment.
- Data quality from CX/CRM (missing or inconsistent) may affect reports and commission accuracy.
- Over-notification to Sales on registrations and audits; need throttle or digest if volume spikes.
